//this problem is a simple probability problem, I used inclusion-exclusion
//principle on this one, first figure out the probability is p3, then start from
//one ball, and count the number of zero cnt bins, 1 cnt bins, 2 cnt bins and p3. using something like markov process, to find out when 20000 balls is reached
//what is p3.
